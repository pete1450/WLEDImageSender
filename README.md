# WLEDImageSender
Easily send an image to a WLED matrix. Copilot wrote it.

1. Choose the ip of your WLED matrix
2. Specify a matrix size
3. Load an image
4. Drag your bounding box around, drag outside it to scale
5. Click Generate Matrix to generate and send

I was playing around with sending single pixels so that is an option at the bottom too. This will show the rquest and the response.
